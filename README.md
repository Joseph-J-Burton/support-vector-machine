# SVM project exercise

## Purpose of Project
This is a project that is from Pierian Data's Machine Learning Course.
The project analyzes a physicochemical wine properties data set. The project goes through the process of exploring, cleaning and organizing the data, creating a machine learning model, and evaluating the model. The model is designed to use the data to determine if the wine is genuine or a fake.  
Using a portion of the data to train a Support Vector Classifier model. Then use the remaining data to check the performance of the model.
The process uses a grid search to optimize the model parameters.
Then I evaluate the model performance using classification report.
The end goal is to have a model that can efficiently predict if the wie is genuine based on the wine chemical properties.

## Program version
Python version 3.9.12
Jupyter Notebook version 6.4.8
Visual Studio version 1.73.1  

## Skills
Read in data using pandas
Explore data set using pandas
Create visuals using Seaborn and matplotlib
Create a correlation clustermap through the use of Seaborn.  
Categorical substitution through dummy variables.  
Scale data through using scikit-learns standard scaler.  
Use of a Support vector classifier.    
Optimize parameters though using GridSearchCV from scikit-learn
Model performance evaluation using confusion matrix and classification report from scikit-learn metrics.    

## Improvements
I need to go through the project and try adjusting other parameters to see if I can improve the efficiency of the model.
It may be good to reduce the lines by removing some redundancy of coding, e.g. looking at the data set after doing some filtering of the data frame. I may need to include more explanation of the code.  
I need to make it easier for a user to input the chemical ingredients to see if the wine is a fraud.

## Comments
I chose to include this exercise in my portfolio because it demonstrates the skills to organize data and use of the machine learning support vector classifier methods.
I found the machine learning course to be very valuable in learning the techniques through hands-on exercises!
